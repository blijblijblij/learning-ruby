# learning-ruby
Just some snippets while underway trying to learning a new language

# questions
- Method defitions: why would one want to `undef` a already existing method? What would be the usecase?

# notes
- `&proc` When an argument preceded by an ampersand, it will accept the block when one is submitted and convert it to a Proc object
